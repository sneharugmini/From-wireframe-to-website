                Doritos is a well-beloved snack by kids and adults alike (much like the love people for Glen Bell's Taco
                Bell). Today, the Frito-Lay Company owns the popular snack and is one of their best-selling brands to
                date. There's something deliciously cheesy about Dorito's crunch. Even its triangle shape is enough to
                send adults back to the pangs of their childhood. The snack is perfect for munching on in front of the
                television, is a great treat to share with friends, and is a fun snack to serve at parties.
            </p>

                Legends state that the Doritos were made in Disneyland by a restaurant owned by the Frito Company, the
                Casa De Fritos. The restaurant was located on New Orlean's Street, beside Aunt Jemima's Pancake House.
                The legend goes that the staff at Casa De Fritos was asked to fry the excess and stale tortillas. These
                fried tortillas would become the Doritos that people are familiar with today.
            </p>

            <p>
                The original flavor of Doritos—though shaped into thin and wedged triangles—hardly resembled the tangy
                nacho cheese flavor the brand is known for today. At the time, the chip was relatively flavorless and
                vaguely tasted buttery. Despite its mild taste, it was still well received!
